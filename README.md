# Spogo

Co-founded Spogo, a platform to connect college athletes to monetizable opportunities, taking advantage of the new NIL law change. We developed a shareable link-in-bio profile, where athletes could add their experiences, accomplishments, highlights, personal information, and much more. Our code stack used React.js and Google's Firebase suite of tools such as authentication, file storage, and their noSQL database Firestore. Additionally, we used React Native to create the Spogo App. We had over 30+ people on our waitlist.

We also applied to Y-Combinator, and while we unfortunately didn't get accepted, we were told that we were in the top 10% of applicants out of almost 15,000 applications worldwide.
